# Task 011: Real-time Model Serving with A/B Testing

## Problem Statement
Add real-time model serving capabilities to existing batch prediction system with comprehensive A/B testing framework.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Real-time Serving Infrastructure**
   - Implement low-latency model serving with sub-100ms response times
   - Add dynamic model loading and version management
   - Implement request routing and load balancing
   - Add caching layers for frequently requested predictions

2. **A/B Testing Framework**
   - Implement traffic splitting with configurable percentages
   - Add statistical significance testing with proper sample sizes
   - Implement champion/challenger model comparison
   - Add automated model promotion based on performance metrics

3. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring for model performance
   - Add business metrics tracking and correlation analysis
   - Implement automated alerting for performance degradation
   - Add experiment analysis and reporting capabilities

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Model Serving**: TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, MLflow, KServe
- **A/B Testing**: Traffic routing, statistical testing, experiment tracking
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, custom metrics, alerting
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, service mesh, load balancing

### Deliverables
