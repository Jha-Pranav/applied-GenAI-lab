# Task 006: Memory Leak in ML Training Pipeline

## Problem Statement
Diagnose and fix memory leaks in distributed PyTorch training jobs running on Kubernetes, causing OOM kills and training failures.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Memory Leak Diagnosis**
   - Implement comprehensive memory profiling for PyTorch training
   - Identify gradient accumulation and tensor lifecycle issues
   - Analyze data loading and preprocessing memory patterns
   - Profile distributed training communication overhead

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Investigate CUDA memory management issues
   - Analyze Python garbage collection patterns
   - Identify memory leaks in custom operators and extensions
   - Review shared memory usage in multi-process data loading

3. **Fix Implementation**
   - Implement proper tensor cleanup and memory management
   - Optimize data loading with memory-efficient strategies
   - Add memory monitoring and alerting mechanisms
   - Implement automatic job restart with state preservation
