      "\u001b[38;2;200;100;120mOkay, the user is asking why the sky is blue. I need to explain the science behind it. Let me start by recalling what I know about the scattering of light in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, sunlight appears white, but it's made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to colors like red or yellow. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. This interaction causes the light to scatter in all directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that Rayleigh scattering is the main principle here. It states that the intensity of scattered light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. So shorter wavelengths (blue, violet) scatter more than longer ones (red, orange). That's why the sky appears blue instead of violet, even though violet has an even shorter wavelength. Wait, why isn't it violet then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh right, the sun emits more blue light than violet, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue. Plus, some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere. Also, during different times of the day, the sky can look different. Like, during sunrise or sunset, the sky is red or orange because the light has to pass through more atmosphere, scattering out the blue, leaving the longer wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention the role of the atmosphere's composition and how Earth's atmosphere isn't perfectly clear. Maybe also touch on how the same effect explains why the ocean is blue, but that's a different part. The user might be interested in the basic science here. Let me structure this step by step: sunlight composition, scattering process, Rayleigh scattering explanation, why blue and not violet, and the daytime vs. sunset effect. Avoid technical jargon but make sure the explanation is accurate. Check if I need to mention any other factors like pollution or particles, but maybe that's complicating it. Keep it simple and focused on the main points. Also, clarify that the sky's color is a combination of all scattered light, but blue is dominant. Make sure to conclude with a summary.\u001b[0m\n",
