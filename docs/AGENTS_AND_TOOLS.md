# Agents and Tools

## ü§ñ Current System Components

### üéØ Core Agent (1 Active)

#### **BuddyAgent** (`agentic/client.py`)
- **Purpose**: Unified AI assistant with intelligent routing capabilities
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Automatic request analysis and routing decisions
  - Direct tool usage for simple tasks (file operations, code execution)
  - Intelligent routing to specialized agents for complex analysis
  - Real-time streaming responses with thinking process
- **Routing Logic**: 
  - **Simple tasks** ‚Üí Direct tool usage
  - **Comparison questions** ‚Üí Route to DebateAgent
  - **Complex projects** ‚Üí Route to TaskPlanner
- **Model**: Qwen 3:14B with streaming output
