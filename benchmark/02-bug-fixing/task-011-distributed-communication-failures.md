# Task 011: Distributed System Communication Failures

## Problem Statement
Fix cascading failures in distributed microservices architecture caused by network partitions, service timeouts, and message queue backlogs.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Failure Pattern Analysis**
   - Identify communication failure patterns and root causes
   - Analyze network partition handling and split-brain scenarios
   - Investigate timeout configurations and cascade failures
   - Review message queue backlog and processing delays

2. **Resilience Implementation**
   - Implement circuit breaker patterns for service protection
   - Add proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Implement bulkhead patterns for resource isolation
   - Add graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms

3. **Monitoring & Recovery**
   - Implement distributed tracing for failure correlation
   - Add comprehensive health checks and service discovery
   - Create automated recovery and self-healing mechanisms
   - Document incident response and escalation procedures

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads, timeouts
- **Communication**: Service mesh, message queues, load balancing
- **Monitoring**: Distributed tracing, health checks, alerting
- **Recovery**: Auto-scaling, failover, self-healing

### Deliverables
- Communication failure analysis with pattern identification
- Resilience patterns implementation across all services
- Comprehensive monitoring and tracing for distributed systems
- Automated recovery mechanisms and self-healing capabilities
- Incident response procedures and runbooks

### Success Criteria
- Elimination of cascading failures in distributed systems
- Improved system resilience and fault tolerance
- Automated failure detection and recovery
- Comprehensive observability for distributed communications

### Complexity: Expert
**Skills Required:** Distributed systems, resilience patterns, monitoring, troubleshooting
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours
**Agent Coordination:** Distributed systems architect + SRE + Network engineer
