Project Request â†’ Complexity Analysis â†’ Task Breakdown â†’ Dependency Resolution â†’ Execution Planning â†’ Validation
```

#### Core Parameters
```python
{
    "request": "Create a Python web API with authentication",  # Project description
    "max_tasks": 10,                                          # Optional: task limit
    "complexity_level": "auto",                               # Optional: auto/simple/complex
    "execution_mode": "sequential"                            # Optional: sequential/parallel
}
```

#### Planning Architecture

##### 1. **Project Analysis Phase**
```python
# Complexity assessment
{
    "project_type": "web_api",
    "estimated_complexity": "moderate", 
    "required_skills": ["python", "web_development", "authentication"],
    "estimated_duration": "4-6 hours",
    "risk_factors": ["security", "scalability"]
}
```

##### 2. **Task Decomposition**
```python
# Hierarchical task breakdown
{
    "main_tasks": [
        {
            "id": "task_001",
            "title": "Project Setup",
            "description": "Initialize project structure and dependencies",
            "subtasks": [
                "Create virtual environment",
                "Install Flask/FastAPI",
                "Setup project structure"
            ],
            "dependencies": [],
            "estimated_time": "30 minutes"
        },
        {
            "id": "task_002", 
            "title": "Authentication System",
            "description": "Implement user authentication",
            "subtasks": [
                "Design user model",
                "Implement JWT tokens",
                "Create login/register endpoints"
            ],
            "dependencies": ["task_001"],
            "estimated_time": "2 hours"
        }
    ]
}
```

##### 3. **Execution Coordination**
```python
# Task execution management
{
    "execution_plan": {
        "phase_1": ["task_001"],           # Setup phase
        "phase_2": ["task_002", "task_003"], # Core development
        "phase_3": ["task_004"]            # Testing and deployment
    },
    "validation_points": [
        "After each task completion",
        "Before phase transitions",
        "Final project validation"
    ]
}
```

#### Planning Strategies

##### 1. **Simple Projects** (1-3 tasks)
- Direct execution approach
- Minimal validation overhead
- Single-phase completion
- Basic error handling

##### 2. **Moderate Projects** (4-8 tasks)
- Multi-phase execution
- Dependency management
- Intermediate validation
- Progress tracking

##### 3. **Complex Projects** (9+ tasks)
- Advanced dependency resolution
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Comprehensive validation
- Risk mitigation strategies

#### Task Generation Process

##### 1. **Requirements Analysis**
```python
def analyze_requirements(request: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Extract project requirements and constraints
    
    Returns:
    - Functional requirements
    - Technical constraints
    - Quality requirements
    - Timeline expectations
    """
```

##### 2. **Framework Selection**
```python
def select_framework(project_type: str, requirements: Dict) -> str:
    """
    Choose appropriate development framework
    
    Considerations:
    - Project complexity
    - Performance requirements
    - Team expertise
    - Ecosystem maturity
    """
```

##### 3. **Task Prioritization**
```python
def prioritize_tasks(tasks: List[Task]) -> List[Task]:
    """
    Order tasks by priority and dependencies
    
    Factors:
    - Dependency relationships
    - Risk assessment
    - Resource availability
    - Critical path analysis
    """
```

#### Validation System

##### 1. **Pre-execution Validation**
```python
{
    "validation_type": "pre_execution",
    "checks": [
        "Parameter completeness",
        "Resource availability", 
        "Permission verification",
        "Dependency satisfaction"
    ],
    "status": "passed",
    "warnings": []
}
```

##### 2. **Task Completion Validation**
```python
{
    "validation_type": "task_completion",
    "task_id": "task_001",
    "checks": [
        "Expected outputs created",
        "Quality standards met",
        "No blocking errors",
        "Dependencies satisfied"
    ],
    "status": "passed",
    "artifacts": ["requirements.txt", "app.py", "config.py"]
}
```

##### 3. **Project Completion Validation**
```python
{
    "validation_type": "project_completion",
    "checks": [
        "All tasks completed",
        "Integration successful",
        "Quality gates passed",
        "Documentation complete"
    ],
    "status": "passed",
    "deliverables": ["working_api", "documentation", "tests"]
}
```

#### Execution Modes

##### 1. **Sequential Execution**
- Tasks executed one after another
- Clear dependency resolution
- Easier debugging and monitoring
- Lower resource requirements

##### 2. **Parallel Execution**
- Independent tasks run simultaneously
- Faster completion times
- Higher resource utilization
- Complex coordination requirements

##### 3. **Hybrid Execution**
- Combines sequential and parallel approaches
- Optimizes for both speed and reliability
- Adaptive based on resource availability
- Intelligent scheduling decisions

#### Error Handling and Recovery

##### 1. **Task Failure Recovery**
```python
{
    "failure_type": "task_execution_error",
    "failed_task": "task_002",
    "error_details": "Authentication library not found",
    "recovery_actions": [
        "Install missing dependency",
        "Retry task execution",
        "Update task parameters"
    ],
    "retry_count": 1,
    "max_retries": 3
}
```

##### 2. **Dependency Resolution Failures**
```python
{
    "failure_type": "dependency_conflict",
    "conflicting_tasks": ["task_003", "task_004"],
    "resolution_strategy": "sequential_execution",
    "alternative_approaches": [
        "Modify task dependencies",
        "Split conflicting tasks",
        "Use different implementation"
    ]
}
```

##### 3. **Resource Constraint Handling**
```python
{
    "constraint_type": "resource_limitation",
    "limited_resource": "memory",
    "mitigation_strategies": [
        "Reduce parallel task count",
        "Implement task queuing",
        "Optimize resource usage"
    ],
    "adjusted_plan": "modified_execution_plan"
}
```

#### Example Usage

""")
```

##### Microservice Architecture
```python
planner(request="""
