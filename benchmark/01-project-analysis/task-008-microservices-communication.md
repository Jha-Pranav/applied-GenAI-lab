# Task 008: Microservices Communication Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze complex microservices architecture with synchronous/asynchronous communication patterns, service mesh, and distributed tracing.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Communication Patterns**
   - Document service-to-service communication flows
   - Analyze synchronous vs asynchronous messaging patterns
   - Map API contracts and data exchange formats
   - Review event-driven architecture and message queues

2. **Service Mesh & Networking**
   - Analyze service mesh configuration (Istio/Linkerd)
   - Review traffic management and load balancing
   - Document security policies and mTLS implementation
   - Assess network performance and latency patterns

3. **Observability & Reliability**
   - Review distributed tracing and correlation IDs
   - Analyze circuit breaker and retry mechanisms
   - Document monitoring and alerting strategies
   - Assess fault tolerance and resilience patterns

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Communication**: REST, gRPC, GraphQL, message queues
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect
- **Observability**: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry
- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts

### Deliverables
- Service communication diagrams with data flows
- Service mesh configuration analysis
- Observability and monitoring assessment
- Reliability patterns documentation
- Performance optimization recommendations

### Success Criteria
- Complete mapping of service interactions
- Clear understanding of communication patterns
- Identification of reliability and performance issues
- Actionable recommendations for improvements

### Complexity: Advanced
**Skills Required:** Microservices, service mesh, distributed systems, observability
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Agent Coordination:** Solutions architect + Network engineer + Observability specialist
