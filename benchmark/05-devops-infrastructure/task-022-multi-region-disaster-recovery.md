# Task 022: Multi-Region Disaster Recovery

## Problem Statement
Design and implement multi-region disaster recovery solution for ML platform with RTO < 15 minutes and RPO < 5 minutes including automated failover and cross-region monitoring.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **DR Architecture**
   - Design multi-region architecture with active-passive failover
   - Implement cross-region data replication with minimal lag
   - Add automated failover mechanisms with health monitoring
   - Create network and DNS failover strategies

2. **Data Protection**
   - Implement real-time data replication across regions
   - Add backup and restore procedures with point-in-time recovery
   - Create data consistency validation and integrity checks
   - Implement encryption and security for cross-region transfers

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Add automated disaster recovery testing and validation
   - Create disaster recovery drills and simulation procedures
   - Implement compliance monitoring and reporting
   - Document DR procedures and communication plans

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Multi-Region**: Cross-region replication, failover, networking
- **Data Protection**: Backup, restore, consistency, encryption
- **Automation**: Automated failover, testing, monitoring
- **Compliance**: DR testing, reporting, documentation

### Deliverables
- Multi-region disaster recovery architecture with automated failover
- Real-time data replication and backup strategies
- Automated DR testing and validation procedures
- Compliance monitoring and reporting framework
- Comprehensive DR documentation and communication plans

### Success Criteria
- RTO < 15 minutes and RPO < 5 minutes for critical systems
- Automated failover with minimal manual intervention
- Regular DR testing and validation
- Compliance with regulatory and business requirements

### Complexity: Expert
**Skills Required:** Disaster recovery, multi-region architecture, automation, compliance
**Estimated Time:** 15-18 hours
**Agent Coordination:** DR architect + Infrastructure engineer + Automation specialist + Compliance officer
