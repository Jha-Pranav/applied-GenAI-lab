# Task 004: Docker Multi-Stage Build Optimization

## Problem Statement
Review complex Dockerfile configurations for ML applications with multiple dependencies, CUDA support, and security hardening.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Build Optimization**
   - Analyze multi-stage build strategies and layer caching
   - Identify opportunities for build time reduction
   - Optimize dependency management and package installation
   - Implement efficient artifact copying and cleanup

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Review base image selection and vulnerability scanning
   - Implement non-root user configurations
   - Analyze secret handling and build-time security
   - Document security scanning integration in CI/CD

3. **Multi-Architecture Support**
   - Assess cross-platform build capabilities
   - Document ARM64 and AMD64 compatibility
   - Optimize for different deployment targets
   - Implement efficient multi-arch build strategies

### Technical Focus Areas
- **ML Dependencies**: CUDA, cuDNN, Python packages, system libraries
- **Build Performance**: Layer caching, parallel builds, build context optimization
- **Security**: Distroless images, vulnerability scanning, secret management
- **CI/CD Integration**: Build automation, registry management, deployment pipelines

### Deliverables
- Optimized Dockerfile with detailed comments
- Build performance analysis and metrics
- Security assessment report with remediation steps
- Multi-architecture build configuration
- CI/CD pipeline integration guide

### Success Criteria
- Significant reduction in build time and image size
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Successful multi-architecture builds
- Comprehensive documentation for maintenance

### Complexity: Intermediate
**Skills Required:** Docker, containerization, ML environments, security
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Agent Coordination:** Container specialist + Security reviewer + Performance optimizer
