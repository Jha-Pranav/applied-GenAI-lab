# Task 007: Data Pipeline Failure Recovery

## Problem Statement
Fix cascading failures in Apache Airflow DAGs processing real-time streaming data, causing data loss and downstream system impacts.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Failure Analysis**
   - Identify root causes of cascading failures in DAG execution
   - Analyze task dependencies and failure propagation patterns
   - Review resource contention and scheduling issues
   - Investigate external API failures and timeout handling

2. **Recovery Implementation**
   - Implement robust error handling with exponential backoff
   - Design dead letter queues for failed message processing
   - Add circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
   - Implement data quality validation checkpoints

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Add comprehensive monitoring for pipeline health
   - Implement SLA monitoring and breach alerting
   - Create dashboards for data freshness and quality metrics
   - Add automated failure notification and escalation

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Apache Airflow**: DAG design, task dependencies, XComs, sensors
- **Error Handling**: Retry policies, dead letter queues, circuit breakers
- **Data Quality**: Validation rules, anomaly detection, data profiling
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerting rules

### Deliverables
- Fixed DAG configurations with robust error handling
- Dead letter queue implementation for failed messages
- Circuit breaker implementation for external APIs
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting setup
- Operational runbook for failure scenarios

### Success Criteria
- Elimination of cascading failures
- Zero data loss during processing
- Automated recovery from transient failures
- Comprehensive visibility into pipeline health

### Complexity: Advanced
**Skills Required:** Apache Airflow, data engineering, error handling, monitoring
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 hours
**Agent Coordination:** Data engineer + Reliability engineer + Monitoring specialist
