# Task 013: Service Mesh Architecture Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze service mesh implementation managing complex microservices communication with advanced traffic management and security policies.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Mesh Architecture**
   - Document control plane and data plane components
   - Analyze sidecar proxy configurations and resource usage
   - Review service discovery and load balancing strategies
   - Map traffic routing and policy enforcement

2. **Security Implementation**
