# Task 016: Automated Feature Engineering Pipeline

## Problem Statement
Build automated feature engineering pipeline that discovers, creates, and validates features from raw data sources with minimal human intervention.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Feature Discovery & Creation**
   - Implement automated data type inference and profiling
   - Add statistical feature generation (aggregations, transformations)
   - Implement time-series feature engineering (lags, rolling windows)
   - Add categorical encoding and text feature extraction

2. **Feature Selection & Validation**
   - Implement feature importance ranking algorithms
   - Add correlation analysis and redundancy detection
   - Implement statistical validation and significance testing
   - Add feature stability and drift monitoring

3. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Integrate with existing ML training pipelines
   - Add feature store integration for reusability
   - Implement automated documentation generation
   - Add experiment tracking and feature lineage

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Feature Engineering**: Statistical transformations, encoding, scaling
- **Feature Selection**: Mutual information, SHAP, permutation importance
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, Dask, Spark for large-scale processing
- **ML Integration**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, feature stores (Feast, Tecton)

### Deliverables
- Automated feature engineering pipeline with configurable transformations
- Feature selection algorithms with validation metrics
- Integration with feature store and ML training pipelines
- Comprehensive documentation and feature catalog
- Monitoring dashboard for feature quality and drift

### Success Criteria
