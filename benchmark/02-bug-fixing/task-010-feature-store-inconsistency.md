# Task 010: Data Inconsistency in Feature Store

## Problem Statement
Resolve data consistency issues in feature store implementation causing model performance degradation and incorrect predictions.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Consistency Analysis**
   - Identify sources of data inconsistency across feature pipelines
   - Analyze feature serving latency and staleness issues
   - Investigate version conflicts and schema evolution problems
   - Review data synchronization between online and offline stores

2. **Data Quality Implementation**
   - Implement comprehensive data validation and quality checks
   - Add feature drift detection and monitoring
   - Fix feature versioning and backward compatibility issues
   - Implement proper error handling and data recovery

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Add real-time monitoring for feature quality and consistency
   - Implement automated alerting for data anomalies
   - Create dashboards for feature health and performance metrics
   - Document data quality procedures and incident response

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Feature Stores**: Feast, Tecton, custom implementations
- **Data Quality**: Validation, monitoring, drift detection
- **Consistency**: ACID properties, eventual consistency, conflict resolution
- **Monitoring**: Data quality metrics, alerting, dashboards

### Deliverables
