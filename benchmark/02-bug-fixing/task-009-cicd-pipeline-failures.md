# Task 009: CI/CD Pipeline Failures

## Problem Statement
Debug and fix intermittent failures in GitLab CI/CD pipelines for ML model deployment causing delayed releases and failed deployments.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Failure Analysis**
   - Identify root causes of intermittent pipeline failures
   - Analyze flaky tests and unstable integration points
   - Investigate resource constraints and timing issues
   - Review dependency management and version conflicts

2. **Reliability Improvements**
   - Implement proper test isolation and cleanup procedures
   - Fix race conditions and timing-dependent failures
   - Optimize build caching and artifact management
   - Add retry mechanisms and failure recovery

3. **Observability & Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive pipeline observability
   - Add automated failure detection and notification
   - Create pipeline performance metrics and dashboards
   - Document troubleshooting procedures and runbooks

### Technical Focus Areas
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI, pipeline optimization, artifact management
- **Testing**: Test isolation, flaky test detection, parallel execution
- **Infrastructure**: Resource management, caching, dependency resolution
- **Monitoring**: Pipeline metrics, failure tracking, alerting

### Deliverables
- Pipeline failure analysis report with root cause identification
- Fixed pipeline configurations with improved reliability
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for pipeline health
- Automated rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- Operational procedures for pipeline maintenance

### Success Criteria
- Significant reduction in pipeline failure rates
- Elimination of flaky tests and intermittent issues
- Automated failure detection and recovery
- Comprehensive pipeline observability

### Complexity: Advanced
**Skills Required:** CI/CD, testing, troubleshooting, monitoring
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 hours
**Agent Coordination:** DevOps engineer + QA specialist + Infrastructure engineer
