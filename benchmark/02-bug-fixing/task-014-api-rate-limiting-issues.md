# Task 014: API Rate Limiting Issues

## Problem Statement
Fix API rate limiting implementation causing legitimate requests to be blocked while failing to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Rate Limiting Analysis**
   - Analyze current rate limiting algorithms and effectiveness
   - Identify false positives blocking legitimate users
   - Investigate bypass techniques and security gaps
   - Review distributed rate limiting consistency issues

2. **Implementation Improvements**
   - Implement adaptive rate limiting based on user behavior
   - Add proper rate limiting for different API endpoints and users
   - Fix distributed rate limiting synchronization issues
   - Implement graceful degradation and queue management

3. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Add comprehensive rate limiting metrics and monitoring
   - Implement real-time abuse detection and alerting
   - Create analytics dashboards for API usage patterns
   - Document rate limiting policies and procedures

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket, sliding window, distributed algorithms
- **API Management**: Gateway configuration, policy enforcement
- **Security**: DDoS protection, abuse detection, threat mitigation
- **Monitoring**: Usage analytics, performance metrics, alerting

### Deliverables
