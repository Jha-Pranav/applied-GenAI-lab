# Task 021: Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy

## Problem Statement
Implement zero-downtime deployment strategy for ML services using blue-green deployments, canary releases, and feature flags.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Deployment Strategies**
   - Implement blue-green deployment with automated traffic switching
   - Add canary release with gradual traffic increase
   - Implement feature flags for runtime configuration changes
   - Add automated rollback mechanisms with health checks

2. **Database & State Management**
   - Implement backward-compatible database migrations
   - Add session management for stateful applications
   - Implement distributed caching with cache warming
   - Add data consistency checks during deployments

3. **Monitoring & Validation**
   - Implement comprehensive health checks and readiness probes
   - Add performance validation during deployments
   - Implement automated smoke tests and integration tests
   - Add real-time monitoring for deployment success metrics

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Deployment Tools**: ArgoCD, Flagger, Istio, NGINX Ingress
- **Database Migrations**: Flyway, Liquibase, schema versioning
- **Feature Flags**: LaunchDarkly, Unleash, custom implementation
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, distributed tracing

### Deliverables
- Blue-green deployment pipeline with automated switching
- Canary release configuration with progressive traffic routing
- Feature flag implementation with runtime configuration
- Database migration strategy with rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for deployments

### Success Criteria
- Zero service downtime during deployments
- Automated rollback within 30 seconds of issues
- Successful database migrations without data loss
- Comprehensive deployment validation and monitoring

### Complexity: Expert
**Skills Required:** DevOps, Kubernetes, service mesh, database management, monitoring
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours
**Agent Coordination:** DevOps engineer + Database specialist + Monitoring engineer + QA engineer
