If a society prioritizes maximizing collective well-being, but
individual actions within that society frequently and unintentionally
undermine that goal due to inherent cognitive biases and limitations,
what ethical frameworks and systemic interventions best reconcile the
pursuit of collective flourishing with the realistic constraints of
human nature, and how would you justify your chosen approach against
potential accusations of paternalism or infringement on individual
autonomy?
