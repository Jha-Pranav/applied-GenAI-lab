# Task 011: Monitoring Stack Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze comprehensive monitoring and observability stack including metrics, logs, traces, and alerting across distributed systems.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Observability Architecture**
   - Document metrics collection and aggregation strategies
   - Analyze log management and centralization
   - Review distributed tracing implementation
   - Map monitoring coverage across all system components

2. **Alerting & Incident Management**
   - Review alerting rules and notification strategies
   - Analyze incident response workflows and escalation
   - Assess SLA/SLO monitoring and reporting
   - Document on-call procedures and runbooks

3. **Performance & Optimization**
   - Analyze monitoring system performance and scalability
   - Review data retention and storage optimization
   - Assess dashboard design and usability
   - Document capacity planning and resource utilization

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Metrics**: Prometheus, InfluxDB, CloudWatch, custom metrics
- **Logging**: ELK Stack, Fluentd, Splunk, centralized logging
- **Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, APM tools
- **Visualization**: Grafana, Kibana, custom dashboards

### Deliverables
- Monitoring architecture diagrams with data flows
- Alerting strategy documentation with escalation procedures
- Dashboard inventory with usage analytics
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Incident response playbooks and runbooks

### Success Criteria
