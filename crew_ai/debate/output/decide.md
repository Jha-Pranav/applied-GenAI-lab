After weighing the arguments presented, the case in favor of a debate on God's existence is more convincing. The proponents argue that such a debate stimulates critical thinking, promotes intellectual humility, encourages interdisciplinary dialogue, supports moral and ethical development, prevents dogmatism, enhances communication skills, and reaffirms human agency. These points highlight substantial, tangible benefits that extend beyond the question of God's existence itself and provide real intellectual and societal value.  

The opposition raises concerns about the untestability of the premise, the potential for binary thinking, the erosion of scientific methodology, the risk of divine command ethics, the misallocation of resources, and the legitimization of dogmatism. While these are legitimate cautions, they largely assume that the debate will inevitably devolve into a futile or harmful exercise. In practice, philosophical debates routinely tackle metaphysical questions without compromising scientific rigor or fostering dogmatism; instead, they sharpen argumentation, expose underlying assumptions, and invite nuanced positions that the opposing side acknowledges (e.g., deism, panentheism). Moreover, the benefits of cultivating critical skills, ethical reflection, and interdisciplinary collaboration outweigh the theoretical risks, which can be mitigated by careful framing and rigorous standards of argument.

Therefore, the motion that a debate on God's existence is essential and productive stands on stronger ground. The constructive advantages for intellectual growth, ethical deliberation, and societal cohesion presented by the proponents outweigh the potential drawbacks outlined by the opposition.
