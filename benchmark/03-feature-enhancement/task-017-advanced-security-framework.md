# Task 017: Advanced Security Framework

## Problem Statement
Implement comprehensive security framework with zero-trust architecture, automated threat detection, and incident response for ML and data platforms.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Zero-Trust Implementation**
   - Implement zero-trust network architecture with micro-segmentation
   - Add identity and access management with continuous verification
   - Implement device trust and endpoint security
   - Add data classification and protection policies

2. **Threat Detection & Response**
   - Implement automated threat detection using ML and behavioral analysis
   - Add security orchestration and automated response (SOAR)
   - Create incident response workflows and playbooks
   - Implement threat intelligence integration and sharing

3. **Compliance & Governance**
   - Add comprehensive security monitoring and logging
   - Implement compliance automation and reporting
   - Create security metrics and KPI dashboards
   - Document security procedures and training programs

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Zero-Trust**: Network segmentation, identity verification, device trust
- **Detection**: SIEM, UEBA, threat hunting, behavioral analysis
- **Response**: SOAR, incident response, forensics, recovery
- **Compliance**: Audit trails, reporting, governance, training

### Deliverables
