# Task 001: Analyze ML Pipeline Architecture

## Problem Statement
Given a complex MLOps project with multiple microservices, analyze the entire codebase structure and provide comprehensive documentation.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Architecture Analysis**
   - Identify all microservices and their responsibilities
   - Map data flow patterns between services
   - Document API contracts and communication protocols
   - Analyze service dependencies and coupling

2. **Pipeline Documentation**
   - Explain model training pipelines end-to-end
   - Document inference service architecture
   - Identify monitoring and observability components
   - Map data storage and retrieval patterns

3. **Technical Assessment**
   - Identify potential bottlenecks and performance issues
   - Assess security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps
   - Recommend optimization opportunities
   - Evaluate scalability limitations

### Deliverables
- Architecture diagrams (system, data flow, deployment)
- API specification documentation
- Security assessment report
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Deployment strategy documentation

### Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of system architecture
- Accurate identification of all components
- Actionable optimization recommendations
- Clear documentation for stakeholders

### Complexity: Advanced
**Skills Required:** System architecture, MLOps, microservices, documentation
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
**Agent Coordination:** Architecture analyst + Security reviewer + Documentation generator
