# Task 013: Security Vulnerability Remediation

## Problem Statement
Address critical security vulnerabilities discovered in production systems including SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, and container security issues.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Analyze and prioritize security vulnerabilities by risk level
   - Investigate attack vectors and potential impact scenarios
   - Review code for security anti-patterns and weaknesses
   - Assess infrastructure and configuration vulnerabilities

2. **Remediation Implementation**
   - Fix SQL injection and input validation vulnerabilities
   - Implement proper output encoding and XSS prevention
   - Strengthen authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Harden container and infrastructure configurations

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement comprehensive security scanning and monitoring
   - Add automated vulnerability detection and alerting
   - Create security testing and validation procedures
   - Document security best practices and guidelines

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Application Security**: OWASP Top 10, secure coding, input validation
- **Infrastructure Security**: Container hardening, network security, access controls
- **Monitoring**: Vulnerability scanning, security monitoring, incident detection
- **Testing**: Security testing, penetration testing, code analysis

### Deliverables
- Vulnerability assessment report with risk prioritization
- Fixed code with security improvements and hardening
- Automated security scanning and monitoring implementation
- Security testing suite with validation procedures
- Security documentation and training materials

### Success Criteria
- Elimination of critical and high-risk vulnerabilities
- Implementation of comprehensive security controls
- Automated security monitoring and alerting
- Improved security posture and compliance

### Complexity: Expert
**Skills Required:** Security engineering, vulnerability assessment, secure coding, compliance
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours
**Agent Coordination:** Security engineer + Application developer + Infrastructure specialist
