# Task 008: Container Orchestration Performance Issues

## Problem Statement
Resolve performance degradation in Kubernetes cluster running ML workloads with resource contention, networking bottlenecks, and scheduling inefficiencies.

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Performance Diagnosis**
   - Identify resource contention and bottlenecks in cluster nodes
   - Analyze pod scheduling inefficiencies and resource allocation
   - Investigate networking performance issues and CNI problems
   - Profile application performance within containers

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Optimize resource requests and limits for ML workloads
   - Implement horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling
   - Fix node affinity and anti-affinity configurations
   - Optimize storage performance and I/O patterns

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Implement comprehensive performance monitoring
   - Add automated alerting for performance degradation
   - Create performance testing and benchmarking suite
   - Document performance tuning procedures

### Technical Focus Areas
- **Kubernetes**: Resource management, scheduling, networking, storage
- **Performance**: CPU, memory, network, storage optimization
